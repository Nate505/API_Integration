# Project Report

## Challenges I Faced
- Challenge 1: JavaFX Setup
    - Problem: Forgot how to setup JavaFX lib and VM Options
    - Solution: Look back onto the Pyraminx Project to see how I set it up
    - Learned: Import the JavaFX Lib first and then add the VM Option
- Challenge 2: JavaFX Code
    - Problem: I wasn't too experienced with JavaFX, so I needed some help creating the UI
    - Solution: I asked Copilot to help/guide me, not give me the code, to get this done
    - Learned: I learned how to code JavaFX

## Design Pattern Justifications
- Strategy Pattern: Needed different Strategies (Popularity or Artist Based)
- Factory: Creating different request based of the strategy chosen by the user
- OBserver Patter: UI Needed to react/return results, and also I included a feedback near the bottom of the screen


## AI Usage (BE HONEST!)
Used Copilot to help/guide me code JavaFX portion, since I didn't know a lot of JavaFX
- Asked: "help guide me code a JavaFX program, DO NOT GIVE ME THE CODE RIGHT AWAY, I am making a spotify Recommender system"
- Modified: Changed their code so that I could use the API Service/API Client myself
- Verified: JavaFX came out like what I wanted it to be

## Time Spent: ~35 hours
